I'm a disabled software engineer with various interests. One of my favorite interests is Table Top Role Playing Games, 
(TTRPGs), second only to programming computers, my career.  I've enjoyed playing and making maps for settings since I 
was a young boy of 11 years. (I'll be 51 as mid-August 2022.)

I also enjoy, and may or may not post about, cooking, container gardening, my pet gecko, electronics or other things
as they strike my fancy.
