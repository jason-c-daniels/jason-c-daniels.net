## About the git-ver scripts
This is a set of bash scripts I've assembled to help with semantic versioning within a git repository. They're still in
very early development, and they're really just an exercise in keeping my bash scripting skills sharp. But if you want
something with no more dependencies than git and bash, these might just be for you. (GitVersion is a well respected tool
with .NET dependencies. Not everyone wishes to install .NET in order to perform simple versioning. It was with that in
mind that I created these scripts.)

## Repository

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[git-ver](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/git-ver/)

## Running Copy

To run these scripts you need to either have git for windows and other dependencies installed, or you need to be running
linux. I've tested these scripts on both Debian 10 and Windows 10. (Yes I like 10's. They're perfect. :-P)

See the [project page](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/git-ver/) for details on installing and running.
