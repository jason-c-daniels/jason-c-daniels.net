## Various TTRPG Tools
During this pandemic I've implemented a few small quick and dirty apps to help people create and maintain
characters for their Fate Core games, among other tools. This is a list of those tools and, when possible, 
a link to a running instance you can use.

## Fate Core Tools
### Fate Condensed Character Sheet
This is a web-app implementation of the stock character sheet that comes with the Fate Condensed PDF. (Also 
available as a separate download).

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[fate-condensed-character-sheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/fate-condensed-character-sheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fate-condensed-character-sheet/)

### Fate Core Character Sheet
This is a web-app implementation of the stock character sheet that comes with the Fate Core PDF. (Also 
available as a separate download). It goes way above and beyond the PDF, however. You can configure what exactly
is displayed, rename skills...etc. If memory serves me correctly there are up to 1028 possible layouts. Although 
only a subset of those will really be useful.

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[fate-core-character-sheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/fate-core-character-sheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fate-core-character-sheet/)

### Fate Character Creation Worksheet
This is a web-app implementation of the stock Character Creation Worksheet that comes with the Fate Core PDF. (Also 
available as a separate download).

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[fate-character-creation-worksheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/fate-character-creation-worksheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fate-character-creation-worksheet/)

### Fate Game Creation Worksheet
This is a web-app implementation of the stock Game Creation Worksheet that comes with the Fate Core PDF. (Also 
available as a separate download).

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[fate-game-creation-worksheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/fate-game-creation-worksheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fate-game-creation-worksheet/)

## Fantasy Age
Fantasy Age is a TTRPG ultimately derived from the Dragon Age video game. It's a simple, and easy to use
TTRPG.

### Fantasy Age Character Sheet
The stock character sheet had a couple of small omissions, and the format was a bit cramped. So I expanded it out
to two pages, and included the missing information.

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[fantasy-age-character-sheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/fantasy-age-character-sheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/fantasy-age-character-sheet/)

## SLUG
SLUG is a universal, ultra-light, general purpose TTRPG. The rules fit on a single sheet of paper and include
examples of game play.

### Slug Character Sheet
You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[slug-character-sheet](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/slug-character-sheet/)

You can find a copy running at: [this location](https://jason-c-daniels.github.io/slug-character-sheet/)
