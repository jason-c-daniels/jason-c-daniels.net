## About the jcd-new scripts
This is a set of bash scripts I've cobbled together to help me with making various .NET Standard libraries.
It's pretty raw right, but does the job and saves me time. I still have to add some template files for
GitHub pull requests, contributing...etc. (I'm adding those manually to each project right now.)

## Repository

You can find the source code at:
{% include icon-github.html username="jason-c-daniels" %}/[jcd-new](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/jcd-new/)

## Running Copy

To run these scripts you need to either have git for windows and other dependencies installed, or you need to be running
linux. I've tested these scripts on both Debian 10 and Windows 10. (Yes I like 10's. They're perfect. :-P)

See the [project page](https://github.com/jason-c-daniels/jcd-new/) for details on installing and running.
