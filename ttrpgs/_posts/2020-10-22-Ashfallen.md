![The world of Ashfallen](/ttrpgs/maps/Ashfallen.jpg)

## Synopsis

This is a world plagued by drought, and a corrupting ash. It's inspired a little by TES Morrowind 
and the areas surrounding Red Mountain, as well as many works of post-apocalyptic near-future fiction.

I've got ideas about why this entire world might be ash-plagued. Perhaps one day I'll put pen to page
and write a setting for this.

## Miscellany

Another random continent from Wonderdraft. No geopolitical boundaries have been defined (just yet.)
