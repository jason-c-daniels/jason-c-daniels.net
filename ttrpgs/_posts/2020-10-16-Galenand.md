![The continent of Galenand](/ttrpgs/maps/Galenand.jpg)

## Synopsis

As I see this continent every nation has a mixed population of every PC and NPC species/race. 
There is no truly good, or truly evil, only the impure pursuits of those who seek power, and those
who seek what they view as justice.

Geographical features mostly determine the political boundaries. And most, if not all, should be
self-sufficient, tho perhaps wanting more of certain resources another nation possesses.

## Miscellany

A random continent from Wonderdraft. The names here are geared towards fantasy TTRPGs.
