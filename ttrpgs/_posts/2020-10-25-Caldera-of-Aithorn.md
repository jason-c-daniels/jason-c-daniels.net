![Map of the Caldera of Aithorn](/ttrpgs/maps/Caldera%20of%20Aithorn.jpg)

## Synopsis

The Caldera of Aithorn sits amid the shattered remains of the, once, continent of Aithorn. Unbeknownst to the inhabitants
the bulk of the continent was a supercaldera. When it erupted, the continent was shattered. The skies turned to ash
and the sun blocked out for ages. It's assumed that nobody on or near Aithorn survived the cataclysm.

This map is of the region hundreds of years after the ash stopped falling. The caldera is still active and is regrowing.
But this has not stopped life from returning to the region. The islands and remnants of the continent are now host to 
all manner of desert island, ash-land, marshy, and lush forest life. A vast variety of plants and animals call this home.
Perhaps some people have reclaimed these lands as well.

The big question now is: Will your players find and stop the source of this cyclic eruption, and near-planet destroying 
event? Is the cycle too long to be of any concern making this merely an "interesting" destination? The choice is yours!

## Miscellany

This is yet another map I made with Wonderdraft. It's 1 part autogenerated and 2 parts manual placement of landmass.

The image is sized to be printed, landscape, at 8.5 x 11 inches on a color printer.
