Another creation using Wonderdraft. No geopolitical boundaries have been defined. This is up to you!

The Verdant Isles are a quintet of misty mountainous islands with lush green forests, ready to host any adventure 
or campaign where lush greenery, marshes and island hopping abound! Scattered among the large, lush, green islands
are a collection of much smaller desert islands with histories and secrets all of their own!
