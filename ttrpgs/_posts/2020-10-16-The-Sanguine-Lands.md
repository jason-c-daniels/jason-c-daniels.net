## Synopsis

The Sanguine Lands are a land of eternal twilight. In the dim light the soil appears a blood red and the flora
are all manner of pastel colors. The marshes and forests are particularly colorful and a sight to see, with the 
mega-flora, often reaching if not exceeding the heights of the mountains. 

These red lands are also the home to some trickster-fey. They will bend any bargain to their whim so long as it abides
by the exact wording of the deal in some remote way. Their homes are in the forests, marshes, and mountains. Although
nobody has found a city or town, per-se, their near ubiquity suggests there's at least one.

The wild denizens of these lands are as brilliantly colored and varied as the flora. Some reports even imply the existence
of mega-fauna, boars the size of houses have been reported, tho never a track of such a beast has been found.
