I have been playing Table Top Role-playing Games (TTRPGs) since I was 11 years old, when I got my first D&D box set.
Along the way I found I really enjoyed thinking of, and sketching out (albeit crudely) what the world might look like.
Sadly I let this hobby go idle for far too long. Recently I've decided to reconnect with doing cartography for these 
games.

In renewing my pursuit, I discovered a wonderful bit of software called Wonderdraft. It allows me to more quickly -- and 
with less fuss and mess -- create maps versus pencil and paper. I've seen reviews for other promising products, such as 
Inkarnate. Sadly with a slow internet connection I can't use these other products. So all maps you'll find here, for the
time being will be created with Wonderdraft or it's companion product Dungeon draft.

As the mood strikes me I may also post Adventure seeds, setting thoughts, and related items. But mostly expect maps to 
be posted here.
